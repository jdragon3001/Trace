# OpenScribe Problem Log

## Current Challenges

### Recording Engine
- Need to investigate optimal screenshot capture frequency without impacting system performance
- Multi-monitor support might require additional testing and edge case handling
- Memory management during long recording sessions needs careful consideration

### Performance Concerns
- Large number of screenshots might cause memory issues
- Need to determine best storage strategy for temporary files
- Image optimization vs quality trade-offs need to be balanced

### Cross-Platform Compatibility
- iohook event handling might vary across different Windows versions
- Screen capture APIs might behave differently on various hardware configurations

## Resolved Issues
- None yet (project in initial setup phase)

## Investigation Needed
1. Best practices for handling system-wide keyboard hooks
2. Optimal image compression strategy for different types of screenshots
3. Most efficient IPC patterns for main/renderer process communication
4. Auto-update mechanism security considerations

## Notes
- Regular performance profiling will be needed
- Consider implementing detailed logging for debugging
- Plan for automated stress testing
