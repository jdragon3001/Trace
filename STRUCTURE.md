# OpenScribe Project Structure

This document outlines the directory structure and organization of the OpenScribe codebase.

## Root Directory

-   `.git/`: Git version control data.
-   `assets/`: Static assets like images, fonts, icons.
-   `build/`: Intermediate build artifacts (often managed by build tools).
-   `dist/`: Final packaged application output (generated by electron-builder).
-   `node_modules/`: Project dependencies managed by npm/yarn.
-   `src/`: Main application source code.
    -   `main/`: Electron main process code.
        -   `index.ts`: Main process entry point.
        -   `preload.ts`: Preload script for bridging main and renderer processes.
        -   `services/`: Main process services (e.g., recording, file system).
        -   `utils/`: Utility functions for the main process.
    -   `renderer/`: Electron renderer process code (React application).
        -   `index.tsx`: Renderer process entry point (React root). Attempts to render an App component supposedly from ./components/App.
        -   `components/`: Reusable UI components (Currently empty).
        -   `hooks/`: Custom React hooks.
        -   `pages/`: Top-level page components.
        -   `store/`: State management logic (e.g., Zustand slices).
        -   `styles/`: Global styles, theme configuration.
        -   `utils/`: Utility functions for the renderer process.
    -   `shared/`: Code shared between main and renderer processes (e.g., types, constants).
-   `.gitignore`: Specifies intentionally untracked files that Git should ignore.
-   `DEPRECATED.txt`: Lists code patterns and practices to avoid.
-   `forge.config.js`: Configuration file for Electron Forge (alternative build tool, potentially conflicting with electron-builder usage mentioned in TODO).
-   `LICENSE`: Project license file.
-   `NEXT_STEPS.md`: Potentially redundant with TODO.txt, might need consolidation.
-   `package.json`: Defines project metadata, dependencies, and scripts.
-   `package-lock.json`: Records exact versions of dependencies.
-   `PROBLEM_LOG.txt`: Tracks persistent issues and challenges.
-   `README.md`: Project overview, setup instructions, and general information.
-   `STRUCTURE.md`: (This file) Describes the project's file organization.
-   `tailwind.config.js`: Configuration for the Tailwind CSS framework.
-   `TODO.txt`: Detailed breakdown of tasks and progress.
-   `tsconfig.json`: TypeScript compiler configuration.

## Key Architectural Decisions

-   **Electron Framework:** Used for building the cross-platform desktop application.
-   **Main/Renderer Process Separation:** Follows Electron's standard architecture. Communication via IPC and preload scripts.
-   **TypeScript:** Used for static typing throughout the codebase.
-   **React:** Used for building the user interface in the renderer process. (Root component location needs verification).
-   **Tailwind CSS:** Used for styling the UI.
-   **State Management:** Zustand (as per `TODO.txt`).
-   **Build Tool:** Electron Forge (from `forge.config.js`) / electron-builder (from `TODO.txt`). Need to clarify which one is primary.
-   **Input Hooking:** iohook planned for capturing user input (`TODO.txt`).

## Conventions

-   Consistent import order enforced.
-   Meaningful comments for complex logic.
-   Explicit error handling.
-   Use asynchronous operations for I/O.
-   Refer to `DEPRECATED.txt` for forbidden patterns.
