# Next Steps for OpenScribe

## Immediate Priorities
1. Step Management Implementation
   - Focus on drag-and-drop reordering first
   - Implement keyboard shortcut recording system
   - Design step merging UI/UX
   - Create annotation system

2. Export System Development
   - Start with DOCX export module
   - Research optimal PDF conversion approach
   - Design progress indicator UI
   - Plan export settings interface

## Technical Considerations
- Ensure all new features follow STRUCTURE.md architecture
- Avoid deprecated patterns listed in DEPRECATED.txt
- Focus on performance optimization for screenshot capture
- Maintain strict TypeScript typing (no 'any' types)

## Questions to Address
1. What format should we use for storing keyboard shortcuts?
2. How should we handle concurrent screenshot captures?
3. What's the optimal approach for step merging?
4. How can we ensure export reliability?

## Development Guidelines
- Write tests for all new features
- Document all architectural decisions
- Keep performance monitoring in place
- Regular updates to PROBLEM_LOG.txt

## Next Team Discussion Points
1. Review current progress against roadmap
2. Discuss any blocking issues
3. Plan testing strategy
4. Review performance metrics
