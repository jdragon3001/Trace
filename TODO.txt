## Notes
- Priority: Recording experience should be smooth and reliable
- Focus on core functionality before adding advanced features
- Keep performance in mind throughout development
- Consider user feedback mechanisms
- Clarify primary build tool: `forge.config.js` exists, but `electron-builder` is mentioned in tasks.
- Consolidate or remove `NEXT_STEPS.md` as it seems redundant with this file.

## Completed Tasks
- [x] Project structure setup
- [x] Initial repository creation
- [x] Basic documentation
- [x] Rebuild STRUCTURE.md
